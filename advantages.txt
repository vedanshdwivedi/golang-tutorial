- Desgined to run on multiple cores and built to support concurrency
- Concurrency in GO is cheap and easy
- Many cloud microservices like Docker, Kubernetes etc have been written in GO

- Simple syntax
- Fast build time, easy to start up and run
- Require fewer resources
- compiles very quickly and CONSISTENT ACROSS OS


Main Use Case of GO:

- For Performant Applications
- Running on Scaled, distributed systems
- Used in server-side or backend language [Microservices, Web Applications, Database Services
]

Characteristics:
